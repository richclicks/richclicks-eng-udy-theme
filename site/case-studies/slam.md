**The customer**

Slam is an Italian brand specialising in technical clothing for sailing, with an assortment of sports and casual wear.

**The challenge**

The results of the first few years in the e-commerce market were not satisfactory for the brand, which was unable to achieve a sustainable ROI on digital channels. In 2019, RichClicks was hired with the goal of doubling online sales in the first year, working exclusively in Italy, Spain and Germany. We followed Slam's digital strategy for all major EU markets, overseeing all relevant channels (Google Ads, Facebook Ads) with a view to performance.

**Our approach**

In the analysis phase and in defining the strategy, we immediately identified a need, investing more in brand awareness and in the top end of the funnel, focusing on the core audience: sailing enthusiasts. Within the Google channels, we gave more space to Display in the awareness and acquisition phase, using all the available features (personalised intent, personalised audience, responsive formats), and we activated Google Search campaigns on unbranded keywords related to the products and the core positioning of the brand (on the whole world of sailing and not only on clothing, as they were directed before). In addition, we added a digital marketing mix strategy with investments in social channels.

The aim was to broaden the client's online approach, making the brand something unique for the whole nautical clothing world, letting the products speak for themselves and being recognised for their exclusive character.

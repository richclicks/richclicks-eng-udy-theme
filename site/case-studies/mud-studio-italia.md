**The client**

MUD was founded in 1997 in Los Angeles, California, by established professional make-up artists and quickly expanded into what it is today: the world's leading educational system for professional make-up artists.

**The Challenge**

MUD Studio Italia hired RichClicks to professionalise its online communication and increase course enrolment at both its historic Milan and newer Rome offices. The objective agreed with RichClicks was to reach a higher and more qualified number of leads, implementing strategies aimed at increasing both the authoritativeness of the online brand and the number of contacts requesting more information.

**Our approach**

In order to achieve the objective RichClicks implemented a full channel and full funnel strategy based on the study of the reference Personas. Ad hoc social campaigns were created with specific messages dedicated to the various audiences of interest and the use of the Google channel was optimised with successful search, display and discovery campaigns, also designing conversion-oriented landing pages. In addition, we managed the Bing channel - with very low cost per lead - and worked on an effective SEO strategy, including the creation of a blog. The email marketing strategy was also important, with the aim of delivering tailored messages.

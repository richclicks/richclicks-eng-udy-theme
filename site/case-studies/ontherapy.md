**The client**

Born in 2016 from the desire to improve the quality of life of people undergoing cancer treatment, Ontherapy is a brand specialized in dermatological and scientific research for the creation of dermo-like cosmetics, which respect the natural physiology of the skin.

**The challenge**

Our aim was to work effectively on the brand repositioning: due to nature of the products, we had to fulfill a sensitive approach. We decided to create a tailored storytelling of the brand by promoting ad-hoc products and testimonial videos, carefully explaining how the products work for healing. The creation of interactive testimonial videos for a video campaign across Youtube was the exact consequence for the optimization of a strategy based on ad sequencing: people watching the products’ videos have been retargeted with the video-testimonial.

**Our approach**

As the core–products are cancer treatment ones,  the challenge was already represented by the fact that we couldn't approach this topic in an usual way. The strategy considered a brand reinforcement, with a particular focus on the brand awareness. To do so, we launched a full funnel video strategy based on a tailored YouTube promotion: the ad sequencing worked perfectly, as 58% of people (more than 500.000) watched the videos entirely, with a viewing rate of 71%. The positive impact on the brand’s business has been immediately more than what Ontherapy was looking for.

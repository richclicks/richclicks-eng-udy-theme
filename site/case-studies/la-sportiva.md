**The client**

World leader in the production of climbing shoes and boots for high mountain experiences, La Sportiva has a success story that has lasted since the late 1920s. The brand continues its winning legacy by choosing to take its message even further, through innovative forms of communication that digital channels make available.

**The challenge**

Our goal for the brand was to create the structure of the new interactive Facebook campaigns, a framework that would bring out the exploratory atmosphere and curiosity for the new, everything that La Sportiva products represent. The RichClicks team's strategy for creating interactive experiences focused on awareness, conversion and traffic, through campaigns dedicated to discovering the world of La Sportiva: embracing the solutions of the new digital advertising, telling the story of a tradition that lives on a strong past and a great present.

**The approach**

To tell the story of the brand and enhance its place in the industry it represents, the goal was to create an ad that included the promotion of exclusive new products, catalogue opportunities and content that communicates the world of the brand and all that its products mean to the user.

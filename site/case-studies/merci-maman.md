**The client**

Merci Maman is an exclusive custom-made jewellery brand, founded in 2007 by BÃ©atrice de Montille, which celebrates motherhood. The brand creates meaningful, contemporary and personalised jewellery, handcrafted by expert hands.

**The challenge**

Merci Maman relied on RichClicks to follow the Website Migration process. Migrations are particularly delicate for a website's SEO, with the risk of up to 50% loss of traffic. RichClicks followed every detail, conducting pre and post-launch SEO Audits, conveying all the necessary information to the client DEV team in order to remain stable and prevent serious errors. Once the positive outcome of the migration was assured, RichClicks took care of creating a content SEO strategy for the multi-language site, to increase visibility in France, Germany, England, Italy, Spain.

**Objectives and results**

The SEO strategy included post/pre migration SEO audit, technical and content SEO audit. A complete keyword research and SEO MAP in English, French, German, Italian, periodic check implementation, SEO consulting, organic performance monitoring, backlinks audit and monitoring.

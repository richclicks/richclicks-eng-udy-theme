**The Client**

Centro Europeo di Formazione offers professional training courses and was founded in Italy in 2007 by the De Agostini Group. It soon received great appreciation in France and Spain for its Distance Learning method. It was later acquired by Gruppo Ebano S.p.A. of Novara, an important Italian company also active in specialist and university publishing, which set up CEF Publishing S.r.l. CEF's success is today affirmed by more than 26,000 students.

**The challenge**

RichClicks handled the entire development of the new website (2016) implementing an appropriate SEO, SEM and Advertising strategy.

**The approach**

We managed all Google channels with the aim of increasing the number of course participants with a cross-channel strategy using Search, Display, Native, Video and Gmail Ads. We also used brand lift to study the effectiveness of our advertising messages.

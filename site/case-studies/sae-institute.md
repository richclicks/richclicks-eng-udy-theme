**The client**

SAE Institute was founded in 1976 and has since grown to become the world's largest training centre for the creative media industry, with 54 campuses in 26 countries.

**The Challenge**

RichClicks was hired to manage search marketing campaigns with the aim of increasing the number of enquiries and lowering the cost per lead from the campaigns, as management was good at the time but not sufficient to fuel the growth SAE Institute needed.

**Our approach**

RichClicks inherited a well-managed account but its team preferred to create the strategy from scratch to leverage the methodology developed through years of experience in the industry. The results were not long in coming, leading to an almost immediate improvement in all campaigns managed. By the end of the first year, Rich Clicks had exceeded all of its targets 4 months early.

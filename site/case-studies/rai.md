**The client**

RAI is the exclusive concessionaire for public service broadcasting in Italy. It is one of the largest communication companies in Europe, the fifth largest television group on the continent. RichClicks managed the SEO strategy and search advertising campaign for the subscription campaign.

**The challenge**

The challenge for RAI's subscription division was to digitise the information related to the licence fee and convey offers, deadlines and promotions of the service to its users, in a faster and more intuitive way, favouring online channels and connecting its users to the possibilities of the web.

**Our approach**

RichClicks created a dedicated campaign, through the development of an ad hoc landing page designed in-house. With the launch of the landing page, the consultancy provided a complete Google Search campaign strategy, to best integrate the necessary information on subscription policies and usage news, optimising SEO traffic and significantly lowering the average cost per click.

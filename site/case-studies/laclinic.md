**The client**

LaCLINIC® is the only organisation in Italy specialising in Aesthetic Medicine and Surgery: something different from cosmetic surgery. A method that focuses on you and your dream of beauty, starting from the results you want, with the minimally invasive approach of the most innovative scientific methods.

**The challenge**

LaCLINIC North Italy relied on RichClicks to increase customers and raise awareness of the brand. The project started with only two locations under management (Milan and Bologna) and thanks to the effective collaboration, it then expanded with the opening of new locations in Desenzano, Varese, Como, Verona. The objective agreed with RichClicks was to reach a higher and more qualified number of leads, implementing strategies aimed at increasing both the authoritativeness of the online brand and the number of contacts asking for more information.

**The approach**

RichClicks manages the ADV channel (Google Search, Display & FB/IG) and through [**RichAutomation**](/rich-tools/marketing-automation) the nurturing of generated leads. Extremely effective Facebook Leads campaigns have been created to be present even during the covid moment with specific messages dedicated to the various audiences of interest and the use of the Google channel has been optimised with Search and Display campaigns. RichClicks designed and created ad hoc, high-performance and conversion-oriented landing pages for each campaign. The email marketing strategy was also important, with the aim of delivering tailor-made messages.

**The client**

Euler Hermes UK is a member of the Allianz Group, with offices in London, Birmingham and Manchester, and has been protecting thousands of businesses across the UK for over a century. The central group, based in Paris, is present in more than 50 countries with over 6000 employees and is listed on Euronext Paris (ELE.PA).

Euler Hermes is a world leader in credit insurance, a company recognised as a specialist in debt collection, surety and guarantee. With a century of experience behind it, it offers companies in the B2B segment financial services to support their client portfolio management.

**The challenge**

The strategy undertaken by RichClicks involves SEO analysis, including an initial technical audit, to identify the targets on which to focus the next steps and help grow Euler Hermes' online channels. The second step, in fact, concerns the implementation of new PPC campaigns, on which to convey the company's message, as suggested by the claim that accompanies them: "confidence in tomorrow", as well as in the challenges that will characterize them.

**The approach**

Our consultancy also includes circular work on CRO and optimising the leads that the company's channels receive: the right incentive to devote ourselves to challenges that feed our passion. Excited by this great new adventure, it's time to roll up our sleeves and set off on the road to success.

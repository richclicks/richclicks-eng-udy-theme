**The client**

My English School is a leading chain of schools with branches in several cities in Italy. The company offers high-level English courses for different purposes (from basic English to business English) and for all ages.

**The challenge**

The brand first contacted us when it decided to digitalise its marketing, customer approach and management, when it only had one school in Florence. The growth of My English School came quickly through our digital strategies and across the country as they built a network of over 30 schools across Italy. As a result, they felt they needed a larger agency to continue.

**Our approach**

MyES decided to join forces with RichClicks for a big leap: the conquest of the international market, targeting countries such as France and Spain and then opening offices in Lyon and Valencia. For us it is an honour to have clients with this imprinting: the message derived from the strategy and the advice offered is that we have provided the best digital service they have found in the market offer, they have trusted ours and chosen us for new and important challenges.

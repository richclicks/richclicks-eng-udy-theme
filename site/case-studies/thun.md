**The client**

THUN is an Italian company of interior decoration, collectibles and gift ideas. The company was founded in 1950 presenting a unique decorative style that involved products of different types under the same decorative philosophy, which represents the values and inspiration of the brand. Today, the company has more than 1000 shops across Europe, including retailers and branded shops in countries such as Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Austria.

**The challenge**

RichClicks was chosen to boost the company's online presence and brand awareness through a comprehensive multi-funnel marketing strategy aimed at creating new audience segments, increasing online sales and developing an omnichannel strategy. In addition, our team developed a brand protection plan together with Google.

**Our approach**

We created a tailor-made strategy to achieve the desired objectives, moving between SEO, Google search campaigns, Display and full-fledged digital activities. Store Visit metrics were implemented into the strategy to embrace the omnichannel focus of the company. Advice was also offered on usability and email marketing. Through this full funnel strategy, the expected results have already been achieved with a positive increase in turnover compared to the previous year.

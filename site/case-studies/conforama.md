**The Client**

Conforama is a French furniture company established in 1967. The brand is one of the market leaders in France, Italy, Spain, Croazia, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Portugal, with hundreds of shops. The company is now part of Steinhoff International Holdings, one of the biggest retail groups in the world.

**The challenge**

**RichClicks was hired to help Conforama penetrate the Italian market** and gain market shares against bigger players and through an omni-channel approach: e-commerce and stores in big cities.

**The approach**

Our advanced multi-channel digital strategies helped the brand grow rapidly in a very competitive market reaching all the pre-defined goals in year one. We also helped Conforama with a new mobile drive to store campaign, tracking store visits on Google Ads. **We have been one of the first agencies to do this in the Italian market.** The Google Shopping campaigns have also been very effective in our strategy, especially in the increase of direct online sales at a very convenient cost per conversion.

**The client**

Sambonet has a history of absolute prestige: founded in 1856, at the beginning of the twentieth century it was a supplier to noble families such as the Duchess of Genoa and the Count of Turin. From the 1960s, the company began its great tradition of supplying hotels and restaurants of absolute calibre around the world. Today, Sambonet is a leading manufacturer of high quality cutlery, kitchen supplies and furnishing accessories for the retail and Ho.Re.Ca sectors.

**The challenge**

RichClicks collaborated with Sambonet and its partner company Paderno. Sambonet offers a wide range of high quality household items, in particular utensils. While Sambonet addresses the customer directly, Paderno dedicates its offering to B2B.

**Our approach**

Our team contributed, from an SEO perspective, to a successful launch of their new websites, ensuring adequate optimisation to achieve online visibility. For Sambonet and Paderno, RichClicks also developed a powerful digital marketing and video strategy.

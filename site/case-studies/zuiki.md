**The client**

ZUIKI is an Italian clothing brand, owned by Ennepi Spa, born from the creative initiative of the Nunziata brothers. Originally from Campania, the company's history began in Naples in 2003 with the opening of its first single-brand store in the heart of the city.

**The challenge**

Zuiki decided to entrust RichClicks with all of the brand's online advertising, with challenging ROAS objectives to achieve. The challenge was to land and successfully exploit the Google channel, still unexplored for Zuiki, and improve the already excellent performance of the Social channel, maintaining very high ROAS even compared to market benchmarks. We also needed to understand how to maximise the efficiency of dynamic remarketing.

**Our approach**

In order to achieve the objective, we had to evaluate the advertising platforms ad hoc for Zuiki and make an effective selection of the channels to be monitored, focusing on conversion channels. Following an accurate analysis, we worked not only on standard campaigns, but also on dynamic campaigns and new SMART audiences, skilfully controlling the most successful channels for Zuiki and consistently increasing brand visibility, optimising ADV performance.

**Google store visit** has become crucial to develop an **Omnichannel strategy**. Thanks to Store Visits, your business can control how many people have visited one of your physical stores after clicking on Ad. Such an advantage, allows you to calculate how much is the revenue coming from your AdWords strategy and drive the integration of your digital marketing to offline profits. Most of the times, one of the main concerns related to Omnichannel strategy is how to follow the customer’s path from online to offline purchases; however, the tools to track the customers’ experience from offline to online have massively improved and measuring is not a real problem anymore.

### **Google Store Visit Evolving and providing better solutions.  
**

For example, Google has recently launched **Store Sales Direct**, a more advanced tool for Google Store Visits which helps marketer experts to upload encrypted email addresses, order value and purchase date to Google and allow you to obtain a more in-depth analysis which will show how much Google AdWords delivered actual revenue. Including more information, a digital marketing expert can develop more detailed reports, not only to analyse the results but also to develop a more effective marketing strategy forwards. In this way, your digital investments are more optimised as your Google Adwords will inform consumers about your business and products while they provide more complete insights into the ROPO effect (Research online, purchase offline), see the campaigns, devices and keywords that work the best to drive the largest amount of visits into your shops and, the omnichannel customer journey.

In short, **Google Store Visits can help you understand your company’s ROI** (return on investment) through your digital marketing strategy and allow your digital marketing experts to base on richer information the step forwards of the elements of your campaign; including bid, spend and ad creatives.

**Google has analysed customer’s behaviour and determined their value when viewing local Ads**, concluding that, those customers who previously accessed to your online Ads will be 40% more valuable than people who just walk into your stores with no previous Ad visualisation. Moreover, online Ads will make consumers 25% more likely to purchase in the stores, as they have been provided with information about your products and the communication needed to reinforce the customer engagement.

The evolution of Google Store Visits makes possible to link attribution measures store visits to search Ads, Maps Ads, Display Advertising, Google Shopping Results and now even local Ads on YouTube, allowing a more solid Omnichannel strategy and its maximum performance which will guarantee to your customers a seamless customer experience. In this way, all the extra values and unique details that your brand provides offline can be integrated into your digital marketing developing too.

### **Machine Learning Integration  
**

All the efforts needed to provide the highest level of sophistication through Google Store Visits are being integrated day by day to make sure that all the aspects of the process are carefully analysed and treated to provide the most accurate results of your strategy.

On the one hand, Google has determined a **minimum time of visualisation for your Ads** to make sure that customers engage with them for a period relevant enough to make it count. In this way, there is a division between all the clicks on your ads and the clicks which are valuable indeed for your purposes.

On the other hand, Google has also integrated Machine Learning to reduce noise in the data obtained. This means that users who are passing into the store only because they were walking by and,  spending just one minute in the store, will not be considered as a visitor; and neither will be counted as a visitor any of the employees who spend hours in the stores. **Machine Learning has made possible that the training of the system to recognise the distinguishing characteristics of legitimate visits**.

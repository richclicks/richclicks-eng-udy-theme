descrizione-servizio: "For many e-commerce businesses, especially after the first efforts of start-up, testing and online advertising strategies, the need arises to continue the growth path with a sustainable and scalable project. Without the support of an expert, it is often impossible to hold one's own against fierce competitors and, at the same time, keep advertising investments profitable.\n\nThe mistake that is often made by those involved in Digital Marketing for E-commerce platforms is to focus almost exclusively on a \"_performance_\" approach.\n\nThis creates a mismatch between the brand and the raw digital sales activity: the result is that the project stops growing and the results are hard to come by.\n\nOur consultants are well aware that a winning e-commerce strategy must be \"**shopper-centric**\", starting with brand and community building and **always putting the end user at the centre**.\n\nFor this reason, [our mission](/chi-siamo) is a proposal that is concretely oriented towards the concept of the future, which does not insist on a single path. On the contrary, it fully embraces the philosophy of \"**test and learn**\".\n\n### **The choice of the right e-commerce platform for your business.**\n\nOne aspect that should not be underestimated is the choice of e-commerce platform on which to build your site.\n\nMagento or Shopify? Prestashop or WooCommerce? Kooomo or custom site? The secret to choosing the right e-commerce platform is to ask yourself some useful questions to define your weaknesses, strengths and business objectives.\n\n### **How to structure the team for an e-commerce?**\n\nEven if you are in the situation where you want to structure an internal team to support your e-commerce we can help you. It is not always sustainable to hire one developer, one graphic designer, one copywriter, two data-entry people, one e-commerce manager, three interns and a couple of customer service representatives. Over the years, we have helped many customers choose their priorities according to their needs and investment possibilities.\n\n### **E-commerce: the RichClicks consultancy.**\n\nRichClicks adopts in most cases a multichannel strategy, given its nature as a Full-Service Digital Marketing Agency. Each step of the strategy is integrated with different web analytics tools, both proprietary and non-proprietary, to maximise the strategic process, also involving our technology partners.Â \n\n**Multichannel marketing** involves your typical user switching between different e-shops, marketplaces and physical shops, using various devices to proceed along the purchase funnel.\n\nIf you feel the need to talk about your e-commerce project, we are here to listen to you but above all to give you some advice, feel free to contact us now."

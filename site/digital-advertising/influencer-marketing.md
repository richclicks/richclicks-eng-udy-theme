Doing influencer marketing in this day and age means catching up with the trend by definition of the last few years. In more technical jargon, it's activating a process aimed at identifying individuals who create high-impact conversations with an ideal target audience. Your brand's, in this case!

Adopting influencer marketing strategies is a vehicle that feeds through social channels, with the aim of expanding your communities and making storytelling even more versatile. But it can also aim to get people talking about your product or service in a different way, through the voice of those who will become your ambassadors, with creativity at the service of engagement.

Social media allows you to showcase your brand, but how does a winning influencer marketing strategy work in detail?

**How does Influencer Marketing works.**
----------------------------------------

The first thing to do when creating an influencer marketing campaign is to ask yourself how the activity can align with the [customer journey](/digitalmarketing/inbound-marketing) of your typical user, or [Buyer Persona](/digitalmarketing/buyer-persona): from awareness to action, from targeted engagement rates to the goals you want to convey with a campaign.

What can all of these factors have in common?

*   Increase **Brand Awareness** and strengthen your brand image.
*   Increase **engagement** and interaction of your **social activities**.
*   Improve **conversions** (e.g. newsletter subscriptions, free trial registrations, purchases etc).
*   Get **data** and **insights** on your clients.

That's it, simply, your influencer marketing campaign needs to start with at least one of these goals.

How to understand if an influencer can be the right one for a social campaign? If he will be able to guarantee the brand he is sponsoring results and a return on his investment?

Well, influencer marketing is not maths, it is first and foremost **creativity and connection**. Of course, there are crucial tools that our agency uses for brands: both to discover new profiles and to assess engagement, to create a database of contacts, to establish a connection over time and much more. 

Let's discover them together.

### **Fundamentals of a great Influencer Marketing Strategy**

Set yourself specific goals. How do you want your brand to be perceived? What kind of influencers can create that perception? What is your mission?

Here are a few practices that our strategy will put in place, once we have considered the brief and carefully studied your targets in the preliminary phase.  

It goes without saying that a lot of choices depend on the budget, but it's worth remembering that a nest egg spent well is more efficient than a treasure trove spent badly. Before you go, determine how much you are willing to spend.

On which platforms do you best convey your activity? What audience do you target? Typology and numbers: are we talking about an influencer with a large following or a micro influencer with a target audience tailored to a certain niche? Tone of voice and storytelling: how do you express your messages? These may be some of the details we refer to in our strategy. But there is also more.  

Choose your search criteria based on your marketing prospects. You don't need to be a surgeon here, but the more precise you are, the more efficient you will be. Tip: proudly exclude those that don't suit you.

Contact influencers and offer them promotions, gifts, gadgets, money, and anything else that will arouse their interest.  

How to create an influencer marketing campaign?
-----------------------------------------------

So what does it mean in detail to start an influencer marketing activity? And how do we, as an agency, help your brand to identify the best techniques for connection and engagement between brand and influencer?

There are many possibilities, so this is a short list of what you can propose for such a collaboration.  

**Gift:** offering free products and services to an influencer in exchange for a review or mention.

**Guest posting:** creating content for an influencer's blog.

**Sponsored content: p**ayment for publishing your brand on an influencer's blog or social channel. You may or may not create the content for the post.

**Content co-creation:** working with an influencer to create content on your website, their website or a third-party website.

**Contests and giveaways:** run a contest and ask an influencer to share your event or giveaway with their followers or readers.

**Takeovers:** allowing an influencer to take control of your social media accounts for a set period of time.

**Affiliations:** provide a unique code that gives influencers a percentage of every sale they generate.
